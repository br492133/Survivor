# General Introduction

**Topic:**
What can the reality TV show Survivor show us about teh realitionship between the facets of teamwrok quality, teamwork wuality as a whole, and the opportunity to succeed in post-collaborative 

**Definitions:**

<ins>Post-Collaboration competition:</ins> The period after the team in study has been dissolved, either due to project completion or any other reason, and former team members compete against one another for individual gain.

<ins>Teamwork Quality:</ins> A measure of collaboration as measured by the facets of communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion. (Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001)

<ins>Team Success:</ins> the extent to which a team meets established objectives. (Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001)

<ins>Individual Opportunity for Success:</ins> the opportunity to compete in a post-collaboration competition.

<ins>Individual Success:</ins> An individual winning the post-collaboration competition.

## Introduction
Ad hoc teams dominate the professional and academic landscape. Individuals are brought together from a wide variety of backgrounds and interests and made to work towards a common goal. This technique is prolific because a functional team is greater than the sum of its parts and when functioning properly, generates significantly better results than an individual working alone.

A common assumption is that individuals should be motivated to dedicate personal effort towards team success because the individual succeeds as the team succeeds. However, with many team projects there are post-project rewards such as individual commendations, promotions, and various other follow-on opportunities that result at project closure and appear as a zero-sum competition. As is repeatedly evidenced in modern business culture, individuals can emerge heroic covered in the ashes of their failed team projects, and superstars can be completely overshadowed by the success of their team.

It is largely accepted that high teamwork quality produces more team success. It is also accepted that individual effort and attitudes within the team directly affect teamwork quality. From these ideas one can easily deduce that an individual wanting team success should dedicate effort toward increasing teamwork quality.

However, given that there are competitive opportunities for advancement extended to individuals following most projects, the individual is presented with an economy of effort dilemma: Is it more individually beneficial to focus effort primarily on winning the individual post-project competitions, or to focus on enhancing teamwork quality? Taken in consideration of the idea that individual team member attitude is a driver of team success, there is clear potential for conflict, team malfunction, and failure if individual goals supersede team objectives.

This study will examine teamwork quality and individual success as present in the reality TV show Survivor in an effort to determine the relationship between teamwork quality and individual team member opportunity for success in post-project competitions. 

If it is found that teamwork quality is positively correlated with individual opportunity for success, it will confirm that, regardless of personal ambitions to win post-collaboration competitions, the individual should pursue a course of action that increases teamwork quality, and by extension team success. 

**Purpose Statement**
The purpose of this study is to determine which individual attitude towards teamwork quality during the collaborative period of team projects is the best mechanism to maximize team member opportunity for success in related post-collaboration competition(s) and to determine which facets of teamwork quality have the greatest effect on that end.

**Contributions**

- A model of how unique facets of teamwork quality effect team member opportunity for success in post-collaboration competition. This contribution provides the broader community with a framework to economize teamwork quality specific efforts during the collaborative period. 

- A quantitative assessment to answer the question of whether team members in collaborative environments should focus on teamwork quality or individual post-collaboration ambitions. This specific contribution will provide insight that will allow team leaders to manage team member expectations and restructure incentives to ensure high teamwork quality through the collaborative period.

**Related Work**

Discuss briefly about published matter that technically relates to your proposed work in 4-5 paragraphs.

**Problem Statement**
Many Ad hoc team projects contain elements of competitive individual post-collaboration rewards. Individual team members view other team members as eventual competitors for those rewards during execution of the team project. Individually motivated behaviors can be damaging to teamwork quality and result in diminished team performance. This study will observe the participants of the reality TV show Survivor to investigate the relationship between teamwork quality and individual opportunity for success in post-collaboration competition.

**Proposed Solution**


**Research Questions**

What facets of teamwork quality are the best indicators of a team that will produce opportunity for individual success in post-collaboration competition?

Is there a correlation between teamwork quality during a cohort collaborative phase and individual opportunity for success dutin post-collaboration competition?

To what degree does total teamwork qualtiy during a collaborative phase effect individual success in post-collaboration competition? 

**Hypothesis**
H1: Teams that score higher in overall teamwork quality will produce greater opportunity for individual success in post-colaboration competions.

H2: Teams with higher teamwork quality scores will produce individuals that acheive individual success more frequently than deams that score lower in teamwork quality.

H3: Some facets of teamwork quality will be more significant indicators of opportunity for success than others.


**Research Method/Approach**

The reality TV show Survivor provides an ideal scenerio for testing the variables presented by the problem that is the focus of this study.

Survivor consists of a team collaboration period and an individual post-collaboration period. Teams are Ad hoc and compete in a wide array of cognitive and physical team challenges, and only one individual ultimately wins the competition.

For the pusposes of this study the following details apply:

<ins>Sample Population:</ins> Survivor contestants (taken as a cross-section of the US demographic)

<ins>Sample Size:</ins> 80-120 (this represents 2-3 teams in each of 40 seasons )

<ins>Independent Varaibles:</ins>

Teamwork Quality
- Communication
- Coordination
- Balance of Member Contributions
- Mutual Support
- Effort
- Cohesion

<ins>Dependent Variables:</ins> 

Individuals placed in the final 4*

Individual season winners produced

<ins>*Note:</ins> the number 4 was chosen to represent opportunity for success based on the Survivor format - the final 3 to 4 contestants in any season are the only ones allowed to compete for final victory in that season.

Observations:

An observation period shall refer to one team challeng event in one episode of Survivor.

Raters will be considered "blind" to the final outcome of any observed period.

Raters will observe all teams participating in a team challenge during the selected observation period.

At the conlcusion of the observation period, the rater will enter their observations for each team into the "Teamwork Quality Assessment Tool".

The [Teamwork Quality Assessment Tool](http://ucf.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2gg1V4BExgotmMB) records the raters observations of the teams' performance in the dimentions of the six factes of teamwork quality as outlined by Hoegl & Gemuenden.

The data recorded within the assessment tool will then be implimented in statistical software as well as plotted in R Studio to obtain a graphical depiction of any possible correlations between independent and dependent variables.
