## General Introduction
 
(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
Survivor and large-format reality TV game shows pit competitors against each other to win large sums of money. Survivor in particular is a long running show consisting of 40 seasons, the winner of each season receives a million dollars. These competitions generally follow a deterministic structure (e.g. one player will win, a player is guaranteed to 

### - EDIT/Alternate
Survivor provides a unique format that samples a large portion of the total American demographic across a broad spectrum of challenging situaiton. This unique 'laboratory' provides opportunity to study a litny of human interaction variables and well as personal performance dimensions under a series of variables that are otherwise difficult to replicate. The model provided by the survivor format allows for a detailed study of cohort mentality, specifically as it relates to cooperative behaviors in a competetive situation where only one person will ultimately win.

Things to research:
Applicability of Nash-equilibrium to Survivor strategy (if any? If so, is it predictive? At what moments?)



(Motivation. Why is this problem interesting and relevant to the research community?)
 
(Proposed Solution. How do we propose to tackle this problem (that has been identified in the previous paragraphs, is interesting to the community, and has yet to be tackled by other researchers)?)
 
(Contributions. An enumeration of the contributions of the senior design project)
 
(This project makes the following contributions:)(you must have this!!)
•   Research into team dynamics, specifically, if individual performance within the team affects (positively or negatively) the individuals final outcome.
•   A model for cohort cooperation and competetive advantage
 
 
## Related Work

Concerining Survivor specifically, there is a lack of literature and study regarding demographic performance data and how to win the game. Most "research" is published in on fansites and other sources that lack peer review. There is, however, some superficial study that compares a few seasons and the racial and gender issues that might confront contestants, although none of the studies employ quantative mechanisms of study.

Regarding team work in competetive and non-competetive settings there is a much broader canon of literature, however this literature is limited to organizations and high performing or low performing organizations correlated to results and outcome types. There is little research relating to individual performance within a team and later successes they obtain. Research at the individual level is focused on the leader and not just on the team members (accepting team performance as a wrapper for individual team member performance). As such, there is a wide body of literature and a general acceptance of the idea that high performance teams can both generate/propel leadership attribute in the individual to a level of greatness, and that great leaders can make great teams and bad leaders maek bad teams.

There is still seems to be a void of information regarding cooperative actions taken to advance individual standing in the long run during zero-sum hybrid competetive-collaborative game play. Further literature review is pending, however.


Discuss briefly about published matter that technically relates to your proposed work in 4-5 paragraphs.

The final project will consist of a: (1) Pitch - team formation, (2) proposal,  (3) midpoint review, (brief) presentation (~ 15min), and a final paper/code/data. This will be a group work project of a small team.


Look at the winner from a season and their team’s performance in team-based activities given throughout the season and measure team performance, compare performance scores across all of the teams that season’s winner participated in for challenges to see score trends
Do higher team performance measures correlate with overall survivor game performance (i.e., are the teams that the winner of survivor is on better performing than other teams on average)?

H1: Survivor Winners teams score, on average, higher on the Teamwork Quality measure (Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001) than other teams during high workload tasks.
