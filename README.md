# General Introduction

**Topic:**<br>
This study uses Survivor as a series of case studies to evaluate measures of teamwork quality and evaluate opportunity or success. This study ultimately seeks to answer the economy of effort question all individual on a team face: Is it more advantageous to focus on personal ambition or the quality of the team?<br>

**Definitions:**

<ins>Post-collaboration / post-project:</ins> The period after the team in study has been dissolved, either due to project completion or any other reason, and former team members compete against one another for individual gain.  <<<<< Do we need this one?

<ins>Teamwork Quality:</ins> A measure of collaboration as measured by the facets of communication, coordination, balance of member contributions, mutual support, effort, and cohesion. (Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001)<br>

<ins>Team Success:</ins> the extent to which a team meets established objectives. (Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001)<br>

<ins>Opportunity for Success:</ins> the opportunity to compete in a post-collaboration competition. Placing in the Final 4.<br>

<ins>Individual Success:</ins> Winning the post-collaboration competition or post-project reward. The Sole Survivor.<br>

## Introduction
Teamwork dominates the professional and academic landscape. It is difficult to find a job that does not involve some measure of teamwork or to pass an interview without demonstrating some evidence of having functioned as a member of a team. **CCC** Combining skilled individuals onto teams is a way to maximize creative talent, cross-level skills, and produce a much stronger product that one individual working alone. When teams are aligned towards a common goal, productivity can usually be assumed, and outcomes will approach optimization. <br>

However, teams are still made of individuals and people live individual lives and enjoy individual recognition and rewards. Leaders struggle to find ways to motivate individual to commit to team goals and often resort to introducing individual rewards. Introducing individual rewards can create a conflict of interest and a aggravate the ever-present challenge of maintaining balance between individual and collective goals.<br>

Background

In the current professional setting, teams are purpose built, meaning they are not created simply for the sake of being. This specific purpose may present itself in a way that inherently defines success differently for the team and the individual members of the team (Brown et al., 2016). Teams are also typically brought together in an Ad hoc fashion (Stone et al., 2010) and composed of multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary elements (Flowers et al., 2000). The transdisciplinary nature of these teams means that they already come at problems, and even teamwork, from different vantage points (Zeigler, 1990). This complicates attempts to maintain a singular focus on team objectives, particularly because interests and goals may not be aligned at the disciplinary level, let alone the individual level (Garrett-Jones et al., 2005). <br>

The rift that often misaligns team and individual goals is further exacerbated by the existence of individual rewards that are extraneous, or at least tangential to, the overall team goal. These include individual rewards like personal recognition for contributions, a promotion going to the highest performing member of the team, or a follow-on research grant. Individuals competing for individual goals beyond the larger team goal can have an impact on overall team success.<br>






**Purpose Statement**
The purpose of this study is to determine which individual attitude towards teamwork quality during the collaborative period of team projects is the best mechanism to maximize team member opportunity for success in related post-collaboration competition(s) and to determine which facets of teamwork quality have the greatest effect on that end.

**Contributions**

- A model of how unique facets of teamwork quality effect team member opportunity for success in post-collaboration competition. This contribution provides the broader community with a framework to economize teamwork quality specific efforts during the collaborative period. 

- A quantitative assessment to answer the question of whether team members in collaborative environments should focus on teamwork quality or individual post-collaboration ambitions. This specific contribution will provide insight that will allow team leaders to manage team member expectations and restructure incentives to ensure both high teamwork quality  and a positive attitude towards teamwork through the collaborative period.

####**Related Work**####


The framework for this study is built on the scaffold of several previous investigations into teamwork and team functionality. The primary work called upon in the formation of this stud is Hoegl & Gemuenden's 2001 article, ["Teamwork Quality and the Success of Innovative Projects: A Theoretical Concept and Empirical Evidence"](relevant_papers/Teamwork_Quality_and_the_Success_of_Innovative_Pro.pdf) published in the journal <em>Organization Science</em>. This article both establishes a definition for Teamwork Quality, that is used throughout this study, and provides a framework and tool for quantitatively assessing the measure of Teamwork Quality. The study includes methods for weighting the different facets and conducting final aggregation of the collected data.

Hoegl & Gemuenden’s findings in that article also provide support for the idea that increasing teamwork quality increases team success. These findings form the basis for this study's implication that a positive correlation between teamwork quality individual opportunity for success will increase the individual's desire to emphasize teamwork quality and thereby team performance.

The broader correlation and assumption of contribution for this study is based on a 2002 study conducted at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln by Adams & Ulloa and published in <em>Team Performance Management</em>, titled ["Attitude Toward Teamwork and Effective Teaming"](relevant_papers/Attitude%20toward.pdf). The study effectively validated that individuals' attitude toward teamwork directly affected the productivity of their team. In light of these findings this study makes the claim, that should a positive correlation be found between teamwork quality and individual success, a positive attitude shift will work in tandem with increased teamwork quality to yield better overall team performance.



**Problem Statement**
Many Ad hoc team projects contain elements of competitive individual post-collaboration rewards. Individual team members view other team members as eventual competitors for those rewards during execution of the team project. Individually motivated behaviors can be damaging to teamwork quality and result in diminished team performance. This study will observe the participants of the reality TV show Survivor to investigate the relationship between teamwork quality and individual opportunity for success in post-collaboration competition.

**Proposed Solution**


**Research Questions**

What facets of teamwork quality are the best indicators of a team that will produce opportunity for individual success in post-collaboration competition?

Is there a correlation between teamwork quality during a cohort collaborative phase and individual opportunity for success dutin post-collaboration competition?

To what degree does total teamwork qualtiy during a collaborative phase effect individual success in post-collaboration competition? 

**Hypothesis**
H1: Teams that score higher in overall teamwork quality will produce greater opportunity for individual success in post-colaboration competions.

H2: Teams with higher teamwork quality scores will produce individuals that acheive individual success more frequently than deams that score lower in teamwork quality.

H3: Some facets of teamwork quality will be more significant indicators of opportunity for success than others.


**Research Method/Approach**

The reality TV show Survivor provides an ideal scenario for testing the variables presented by the problem that is the focus of this study.

Survivor consists of a team collaboration period and an individual post-collaboration period. Teams are Ad hoc and compete in a wide array of cognitive and physical team challenges, and only one individual ultimately wins the competition.

For the purposes of this study the following details apply:

<ins>Sample Population:</ins> Survivor contestants (taken as a cross-section of the US demographic)

<ins>Sample Size:</ins> 80-120 (this represents 2-3 teams in each of 40 seasons )

<ins>Independent Variables:</ins>

Teamwork Quality
- Communication
- Coordination
- Balance of Member Contributions
- Mutual Support
- Effort
- Cohesion

<ins>Dependent Variables:</ins> 

Individuals placed in the final 4*

Individual season winners produced

<ins>*Note:</ins> the number 4 was chosen to represent opportunity for success based on the Survivor format - the final 3 to 4 contestants in any season are the only ones allowed to compete for final victory in that season.

Observations:

An observation period shall refer to one team challenge event in one episode of Survivor.

Raters will be considered "blind" to the final outcome of any observed period.

Raters will observe all teams participating in a team challenge during the selected observation period.

At the conclusion of the observation period, the rater will enter their observations for each team into the "Teamwork Quality Assessment Tool".

The [Teamwork Quality Assessment Tool](http://ucf.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_2gg1V4BExgotmMB) records the raters observations of the teams' performance in the dimensions of the six facets of teamwork quality as outlined by Hoegl & Gemuenden.

The data recorded within the assessment tool will then be implemented in statistical software as well as plotted in R Studio to obtain a graphical depiction of any possible correlations between independent and dependent variables.
